#  >Overview
Solving challenges is a good way to have fun with code. This is the first challenge and the goal was:

*"... to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go."*

In this case, I selected the mobile layout.

## Built with
- HTML5.
- CSS.

## My process
The main challenge here in my case was to maintain consistency with the design provided.  Because you know, sometimes you got different ideas while coding or designing. At first sight when I saw the card, I was like, mmm....interesting, but once I started to code, ideas were surging. However, my goal was to maintain the the design identical to the requested one . 

Some thoughts:

 - The drop shadow was tricky, because it's very subtle.  
 - I like the font "Outfit" (weird name though).  
 - I'm not a big fan of "blur"
   shadows, but they're ok.

# >Style Guide
Honestly, you don't need a complex style guide (at least for this challenge), but I think is important to have just some clue about the requirements. Anyway, I was provided with the following key requirements:

## Layout
The designs were created to the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px

> These are just the design sizes. Ensure content is responsive and meets WCAG requirements by testing the full range of screen sizes from 320px to large screens.

## Colors
- White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)
- Slate 300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%)
- Slate 500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%)
- Slate 900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%)

## Body Copy
- Font size (paragraph): 15px.

## Font
- Family: [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)
- Weights: 400, 700.
